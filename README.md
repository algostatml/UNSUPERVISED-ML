##### Principal Component Analysis | [Classical PCA](https://github.com/algostatml/UNSUPERVISED-ML/blob/master/PRINCIPAL%20COMPONENT%20ANALYSIS/PCA.py) | [Kernel PCA](https://github.com/algostatml/UNSUPERVISED-ML/blob/master/PRINCIPAL%20COMPONENT%20ANALYSIS/KERNEL%20PCA/KPCA.py)

##### Principal component analysis (PCA) is a powerful tool for data processing and dimensionality reduction. Its objective is to principally determine a subspace that explains most of the variance of the data, by projecting data into this subspace of k less than the original space N.

##### KMeans Clustering | [Classical KMeans](https://github.com/algostatml/UNSUPERVISED-ML/blob/master/KMEANS%20AND%20KERNEL%20VERSION/kmeans.py) | [kernel Kmeans](https://github.com/algostatml/UNSUPERVISED-ML/blob/master/KMEANS%20AND%20KERNEL%20VERSION/KERNEL%20KMEANS/kernelkmeans.py)

##### K-Means clustering is a fast, robust, and simple algorithm that gives reliable results when data sets are distinct or well separated from each other in a linear fashion. It is best used when the number of cluster centers, is specified due to a well-defined list of types shown in the data.

##### Gaussian Mixture Model | [Classical GMM](https://github.com/algostatml/UNSUPERVISED-ML/blob/master/Guassian%20Mixture%20Model%20(GMM)/gmm.py) | [kernel GMM](NAY)

##### Gaussian Mixture Component is a probabilistic soft clustering algorithm which assumes that data points can be generated by any distribution in a mixture of observed Guassians with some reasonable probabilities.
