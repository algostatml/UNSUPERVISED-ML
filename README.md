##### Principal Component Analysis | [code](https://github.com/algostatml/UNSUPERVISED-ML/blob/master/PRINCIPAL%20COMPONENT%20ANALYSIS/PCA.py)

##### Principal component analysis (PCA) is a powerful tool for data processing and dimensionality reduction. Its objective is to principally determine a subspace that explains most of the variance of the data, by projecting data into this subspace of k less than the original space N.

##### KMeans Clustering | [code](https://github.com/algostatml/UNSUPERVISED-ML/blob/master/KMEANS%20AND%20KERNEL%20VERSION/kmeans.py) | [kernel Kmeans](https://github.com/algostatml/UNSUPERVISED-ML/blob/master/KMEANS%20AND%20KERNEL%20VERSION/KERNEL%20KMEANS/kernelkmeans.py)

##### K-Means clustering is a fast, robust, and simple algorithm that gives reliable results when data sets are distinct or well separated from each other in a linear fashion. It is best used when the number of cluster centers, is specified due to a well-defined list of types shown in the data.
