##### Principal Component Analysis | [code](https://github.com/algostatml/UNSUPERVISED-ML/blob/master/PRINCIPAL%20COMPONENT%20ANALYSIS/PCA.py)

##### Principal component analysis (PCA) is a powerful tool for data processing and dimensionality reduction. Its objective is to principally determine a subspace that explains most of the variance of the data, by projecting data into this subspace of k less than the original space N.
